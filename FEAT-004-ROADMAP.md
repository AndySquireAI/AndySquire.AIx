# FEAT-004: Hybrid Website Redesign - Execution Roadmap

**Date:** December 3, 2024  
**Approach:** Option C - Hybrid (Strategic rebuild + preservation)  
**Risk Level:** LOW (incremental, tested steps)  
**Backup Created:** ✅ index.html.backup-20251203-051105

## 🎯 GOAL

Transform current multi-audience site into investor-focused 11-section structure while:
- ✅ Preserving all working functionality (video embed, HMS badges, SEO)
- ✅ Maintaining investor portal (password-protected data room)
- ✅ Keeping technical infrastructure (analytics, Schema markup)
- ✅ Retaining founding projects (AAA, MyHealthCanvas) as credibility anchors

---

## 📊 CURRENT SITE AUDIT

### **Existing Sections (Multi-Audience Structure):**
1. Hero Section - "Empowering Patients & Transforming Healthcare"
2. MyHealthCanvas (FOR PATIENTS) - Patient forms
3. AI Automation Agency (FOR BUSINESS CUSTOMERS) - Consulting
4. Waitlist Form - Lead capture
5. Humanoid Healthcare (FOR BUSINESS PARTNERS) - Main pitch with video
6. eLibrary (FOR ALL USERS) - Resources
7. Collaboration (FOR ALL USERS) - Partnerships (HMS badge here)
8. Mission & Technology - SEO content expansion

### **What's Working Well:**
- ✅ Video embed (YouTube WwxU1KrYACk) in Humanoid Healthcare section
- ✅ HMS partnership badges in Collaboration section
- ✅ Mission & Technology section with teal borders (just fixed)
- ✅ SEO meta tags with HMS mention
- ✅ Schema.org markup (Organization + SoftwareApplication)
- ✅ Google Analytics tracking
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Investor portal (/investors/) separate and working

### **What Needs Transformation:**
- ❌ Multi-audience messaging dilutes investor focus
- ❌ No clear $6M seed funding ask on homepage
- ❌ Founding projects (AAA, MyHealthCanvas) mixed with main pitch
- ❌ No dedicated "Why Now" or "Regulatory Moat" sections
- ❌ Business model not prominently featured
- ❌ Traction section doesn't highlight HMS/JHU strongly enough
